Line 2: A blank line.C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.

Line 3: namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.

Line 4: The curly braces { }
marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

Line 5: class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program.Every line of code that runs in
C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Program.
